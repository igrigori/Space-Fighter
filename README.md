# Space-Fighter

concept:
- my family loves atari games, all of us in particular like space invaders hence the inspo for this project
- you are the green space fighter ship and your goal is to take out the enemy ships (red, blue, yellow)

needs:
- need a style of ships (designed on dinopixel and downloaded for use of the game)
- lasers also made on dinopixel

classes:
- enemy ship class (Enemy(Ship))
- player ship class (Player(Ship))
- laser
- ship class

how to play:
- use mouse click to start game
- space bar to shoot laser
- "A" to move left
- "D" to move right


Work Breakdown:
- initially I was part of a group of 3 however due to communication problems, an unequal amount of work was done by one member in particular; to be fair and respectful our group agreed to split and accomplish our own projects so this whole project was done by myself
- I did receive some outside help via a tutor and beyond the coding aspect I did draw my own ships via a website called DinoPixel
